# A simple working sign-up, sign-in site

Firstly, welcome to this folder and what you can expect from this one? 
* How to connect to db, which I will repeat the same skill in simple-db-write
* How to import and export db from `phpmyAdmin`
* What is going on in this folder? How to perform that sign sign thing :laughing:

## First thing ahead
What should you do when you want to make this site working: 
* Step 1: go to your `localhost/phpmyadmin`(localhost address is not the same for everyone so make it work with the port you configured your `Apache`)
* Step 2: Import `simple-connection.sql`
