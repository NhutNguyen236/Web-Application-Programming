## First step 
The very first thing you need to know what PHP actually is:
* PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.
* PHP is a widely-used, free, and efficient alternative to competitors such as Microsoft's ASP.
* PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, it is weird to say but what is PHP? :thinking:

:money_mouth_face: So, you now know what PHP is but to test it out real quick, you need to use localhost and I am using [AMPSS](https://ampps.com/download), no mean of PR here but it really is convenient
