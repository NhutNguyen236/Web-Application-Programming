## First step 
The very first thing you need to know should be "what PHP actually is?":
* PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.
* PHP is a widely-used, free, and efficient alternative to competitors such as Microsoft's ASP.
* PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, it is weird to say but what is PHP? :thinking:

## How to config AMPPS port when it is used by another service? 
* Step 1: Go to AMPPS install folder and access to folder name *apache* then to *conf* so the path must be *x:\x\Ampps\apache\conf*
* Step 2: Open file named *httpd.conf*
* Step 3: Ctrl + H to open Replace window and find keyword *80* then replace it with something else for example: 88, 8012, etc.

:money_mouth_face: So, you now know what PHP is but to test it out real quick, you need to use localhost and I am using [AMPSS](https://ampps.com/download), no mean of PR here but it really is convenient
