## What is phpMyAdmin?

* phpMyAdmin is an open-source software tool introduced on September 9, 1998, which is written in PHP. Basically, it is a third-party tool to manage the tables and data inside the database

## How to use phpMyAdmin? 
* Usually to open phpMyAdmin, you need to enter this adress *localhost/phpmyadmin* or "localhost: <your port>/phpmyadmin"
* To connect to your phpmyAdmin, use command mysqli("localhost", username, password, dbname)
  
## Lessons description
* We have 2 folders named respectively *A-simple-connection* and *Lab08*. For *A-simple-connection*, I made a very simple sign-up form and connected it to phpmyAdmin to store the data so the main function of this folder is to show the way we write the input to DB and just it. For *Lab08*, it is the main lab so let see.
