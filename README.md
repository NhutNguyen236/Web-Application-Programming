## Tools I used in this repo

* Text editor: [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Local host: [AMPPS](https://ampps.informer.com/3.8/), [XAMPP for Windows 32 bit](https://xamppguide.com/download/xampp-for-windows-32-bit/) - At school, they use XAMPP so I should put it up there too.

## Links
* [TutorialRepublic](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-helper-classes.php)
* [AMPPS for 64bit](https://ampps.com/download) - recommend using this one as your localhost since it is so comfortable, **note that open download link in new window, sometimes traditional download method won't work**.
* [AMPPS for 32bit](https://ampps.informer.com/download/#downloading) - since AMPPS is supported better on 64bit but we cannot forget the 32 one, it is still functionable
* [Bootstrap import](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) - Bootstrap always updates its components and stuffs so please take a look at this to import the right <script>
 * [Badges](https://shields.io/) - Repos are like boxes, they need badges and stamps too. Sooo, what ya'll waiting for? Put them all on.
