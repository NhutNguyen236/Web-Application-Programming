# A SIMPLE LOGIN-LOGOUT USING `$_SESSION`

* Here is my [Main reference](https://www.studentstutorial.com/php/login-logout-with-session) :wink:

* I'm going to just focus on `$_SESSION` only so there will no serious backend

## Skills learned from this folder
* `require` is a very useful syntax in PHP, if you want to create an `index.php` just type in there

```
    <?php
        require('login.php');
    ?>
```

so will see `login.php` runs first even if you are running `index.php`

* The goal of using `$_SESSION` is that when you login to `index` you cannot go back to `login` unless you hit Logout button
